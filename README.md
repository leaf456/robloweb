## Welcome to Roblo on the web.
This is a testing project to see if I can get roblox games into babylon.js games on the web.
### How it'll be done
There will be a roblox plugin that you can press, and it will (hopefully) generate a file that you can put into the web coverter. The web converter will then convert the code into babylon.js code, and it will gives you a js file.
### How you can help
This thing isn't going to be easy, so if you want to help, email me at [email not made yet](javascript:void)
